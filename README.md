# HeartBeats

HeartBeat is a fictional startup that was created by a powerful group of students during our first year in engineering school. Our main objective is to develop a revolutionary headset that can adapt music to the user's preferences based on several factors.

It is important to note that this repository is solely dedicated to the website of our project. The website aims to introduce our team, showcase our product, and allow users to personalize their own headset.


## Lessons Learned

Initially, we gained a wealth of knowledge in the realm of team management and organization. We adeptly utilized external software to carefully split our tasks and were particularly mindful of how to equitably distribute the workload amongst ourselves. Each member choose their work location based on their areas of expertise and where they aspired to enhance their skills.

The Front-End team acquired fundamental skills at an astounding pace, enabling us to make fast progress and establish a strong foundation. We also learned while developing the website by frequently replacing outdated code with cleaner and more up-to-date alternatives. In order to incorporate numerous features, we extensively studied CSS animations, responsive design, powerful algorithms for input validation, and UX design.

The Back-End team was already well-equipped for database development ; in fact, we had a fully functional database even before the official launch of the project. This enabled the team to concentrate on more advanced development, including HTTPS implementation, advanced database protection against DDoS attacks, scalable design, and data statistics. Additionally, we collaborated with another team (G10E) to provide post-quantum data encryption, which is a major aspect that the Back-End team is currently focusing on.

Thanks to our amazing manager the tasks were carefully scheduled. He was aware of everything related to our project and drammatically improved the cohesion and communication between teams. Furthermore, it can be said that he ensured that we always meet the deadlines and that the project is moving smoothly and not accumulating late tasks. 
Our communitcation manager helped a lot spreading our group among our school and making communication on social medias to promote our groundbreaking website.
